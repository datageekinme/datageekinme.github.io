## Tip # 5: Difference between `capitalize` and `title` string functions:

The difference between string.capitalize() vs string.title() is:

'hello world'.capitalize() gives back 'Hello world' which only capitalizes the first letter of the phrase 'hello world'

```python
>>> 'hello world'.capitalize()
'Hello world'
```
'hello world'.title() gives back 'Hello World', which capitalize all the first letter of words in a sentence.

```python
>>> 'hello world'.title()
'Hello World'
```
