## Glossary

### Dynamic Typing
**Python is highly flexible about reassigning variables to different types. This is called as dynamic typing as variables can change types readily.**

Languages such C++ and Java are **statically-typed** and variables are stuck with their original assigned data type.

### Parameters vs. Arguments

With respect to functions in Python, a parameter is a variable in a method definition whereas arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

**Parameter** is variable in the declaration of function and **Argument** is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to a function.
