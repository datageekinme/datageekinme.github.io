## Mastering Python:

To learn python, I used various resources but the course on Udemy by Colt Steele resonated well with me. Concepts are very well explained. Most of my notes around python on this site is based out of this course and my practice during this course. My recommendation is to watch it at 1.5x speed, that worked well with me. :)
